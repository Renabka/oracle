Oracle Card Generator

A minimalist web application that displays a randomly selected oracle card featuring an inspirational message and image. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and is deployed using GitHub Pages. The app randomly selects from a collection of my copyrighted images and messages, each one part of a larger body of intuitive work I’ve created over time.

I created this oracle app as part of my healing work, to give people a moment of clarity, connection, or encouragement when they need it most. Each time the page is refreshed, a random oracle card is shown, along with a message. These cards are infused with the intention to uplift, ground, or spark something meaningful inside you.

This project is a digital reflection of what I believe: healing can meet us in simple and even silly ways, and that a little guidance can go a long way.
